# Social Wallet API deployment

and its storage.  

For more information please refer to https://github.com/Commonfare-net/social-wallet-api

## Configuration

Please follow the next steps before running the service.

### Docker compose
Copy `docker-compose.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml` and change your settings if needed (e.g. port number).

### SWAPI
#### Configuration
Before running this service you must create your own configuration file located at
`conf/social-wallet-api.yaml`. An example configuration file is provided at `conf/social-wallet-api.example.yaml`.

In `conf/social-wallet-api.yaml` replace `YOUR_SWAPI_ID` and `YOUR_CURRENCY_NAME` with your values.

#### API key
Copy the file `conf/apikey.example.yaml` in `conf/apikey.yaml`. The API key will be generated by SWAPI and stored in this file the first time it runs.

### Additional settings
The `host` and `port` on which the Social Wallet API will be running can be specified by using the respectively `SWAPI_HOST` and `SWAPI_PORT` environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Running
Before running for the first time, be sure you followed all the previous steps.

To run this service just use:  
```
docker-compose up -d
```

At this point you shall be able to access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:3000. Click on the 'Authorize' button and paste the API key you get from `conf/apikey.yaml`.
